HSK Web app that takes as input a Chinese text, and outputs the colour coded HSK words with definitions.
It isn't pretty, but maybe someone else could change that!!!

The main program file is called "HSK-Webapp-ARRAY-VERSION.html"

Download all files and save into one folder (eg "My HSK Web App Folder")

Then click on the main html file, called "HSK-Webapp-ARRAY-VERSION.html"

It runs in a web browser.

If there is a file in the download called "main.html", delete that. It is a legacy file that I'm trying to delete (last time, the delete didn't work, but perhaps I just have to wait).
